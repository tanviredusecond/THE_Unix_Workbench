1) first

 *) all
**) README.md
***) clean

are the argument that is used to add
after "make" command

like

1) make all
2) make README.md
3) make clean

now when we use all we define that all redirect
to the README.md file

you can add the all the code blocks
to all so if you add multiple blocks
when you add the blocks
so when the all command applied then all the blocks
will start executing

but we just make the all command to the README.md
command

so when we call the "make all" then only the make README.md
will invoke

and if we run "make README.md" will do the same
if you add the like
now in the README.md

will use the guessinggame.sh file 

so 
README.md command will acccess the guessinggame.sh file

then we create the README.md file

remember

README.md:guessinggame.sh is a command

touch README.md is a file

we create the markdown file
so the headline there will be  "# guiessinggame" just like jupyter notebook

we echo the date and then redirect and append to README.md file
remember you have to use two [$$] doller for this in make file
in bash you actually need 1

then we add the line break
then we count the line of the file and redict to the README.md file


then the 

clean: command 

under this command you will remove the file
so make clean will remove the file
